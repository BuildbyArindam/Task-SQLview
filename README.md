# ðŸ§  Task: Creating Views in MySQL

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

This task focuses on understanding and implementing **SQL Views** using MySQL Workbench. Views allow us to **encapsulate complex queries**, **simplify data access**, and **enhance security** by exposing only the necessary data to users or applications.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **MySQL Workbench** â€“ for database design and SQL execution
- **SQL (MySQL dialect)** â€“ for writing queries and view definitions
- **GitHub** â€“ for version control and task submission

## ðŸ“š Key Concepts

### âœ… What is a View?
A **view** is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It can be used like a table in queries, but doesn't physically store data.

## Steps Performed

1. Created `CompanyDB` database.
2. Created `Employees1` and `Departments1` tables.
3. Inserted sample data.
4. Created `EmployeeDetails` view using JOIN.
5. Created `HighEarners` view for security abstraction.
6. Queried the views.

**Benefits:**
- Simplifies complex queries
- Enhances security by restricting column access
- Promotes reusability and abstraction
